# Wordle App
## App Team Carolina
### iOS Academy Final Project

To combine everything I learned in App Team Carolina's iOS Academy I created a clone of NYT's Wordle website in iOS form. I used multiple Views, Models, ViewModels, and Animations to create the finished product. The app randomly selects a word from the dictionary of all 5 letter words and allows the user to guess. Next the application gives the users hints by flipping over the letters they inputted and revealing hints in the form of green letters for correct letter and position, yellow letters for correct letter and incorrect position, and dark gray letters for incorrect letter and position. If the word does not exist in the dictionary there is a shake animation.
